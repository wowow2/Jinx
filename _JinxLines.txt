She already told you.
I'm asking you.
One of those Firelight wackos was a girl.
With pink hair.
Ugh.
Take some time.
Take it anyhow.
Help. In here, please. Help me.
Help. It's so hot, please. I'm trapped.
I'm a helpless little girl and I've set the building on fire.
Get out. Now.
Also, I brought this dynamite. Goodbye.
Boring...
Boring. Wow. Super boring...
Here we go!
It's all about these runes.
They form some kind of math-y, magic-y gateway.
To the realm of heebie-jeebies. And this... Turns it on.
So... here goes.
No! It was a mistake! It was a mistake.
You told me a million times.
Chuck!
Thieram. Uh... My name's Thieram.
Nice try, Chuck.
What's all the hubbub?
Uh. Boss wants us to grab someone up.
Someone? Anyone?
Who are you grabbing?
Some girls.
I mean, I mean not... I'm not grabbing girls.
Oh, other than the... those ones... I guess.
Focus. Who are they? Why wasn't I invited to the party?
Uh, I don't know.
They... they got in a fight with Sevika. They did a number on her.
Oh really? Which number?
It's like a saying...
You're doing great, Chuck.
Here, for your troubles.
Vi?
Oh, Powder!
I'm so sorry, Powder. I...
I tried to come back. I promise, I did. But I... I got arrested.
Marcus?
I don't know. I... It doesn't matter.
I just... I never thought I'd see you again.
Are you real?
Yes, of course. It's me, Vi, your sister.
I know, Pow-pow, I know. You did what you had to do to survive.
What matters is we're together.
Who's she?
Who are you?
It's okay. She's a friend.
Sevika wasn't lying? You're with an enforcer?
Your sister is Jinx?
Caitlyn, just listen, we can work this out.
This is a trick! You're playing me!
Shut up! I'm in no mood.
Let me help you with that.
Where've you been, Jinx?
Oh, you know. Here, there, chasing down dead ends.
And guess what? They're not all dead.
I can explain.
Don't move, silly. I might hurt you.
I didn't know. Marcus never told me she was in Stillwater.
But you found out she came back.
You lied.
I wanted to protect you.
From what?
She and the enforcer are back for the crystal. Not for you.
Have you forgotten how she left you?
Who found you? Who cared for you? Gave you a home?
I am your family. Everyone else betrays us.
Bravo, sis.
Really thought I buried this place. (sighs )
But I should have known better.
Powder?
Nothing ever stays dead.
Are we alone?
For now.
Maybe forever.
Wanna know a secret?
Silco thinks he made Jinx, with all his rants and his hard-won lessons.
"Excise your doubts, Jinx."
"Be what they fear, Jinx."
Like everything was the same as when Vander left him.
But he didn't make Jinx.
You did.
I'm sorry, Powder.
I never meant to leave you.
You never left.
I always heard you.
Shadows in the streets, prickles on the back of my neck.
Your voice.
Pushing me.
Picking me up when all the colors were black.
You're the reason I'm still alive.
I spent so many nights in that shitty prison.
On the freezing floor, hungry, bloody, counting the hours.
The only thing...
The only thing that kept me going was the thought of getting back to you.
Are we still sisters?
He took everything from us.
Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back.
Just like he planned to do with me.
All the time saying you abandoned me when he knew the truth.
Liar.
Mm. We're missing someone.
Huh?
I paid your girlfriend a visit this morning.
I made her a snack.
Huh?
No! ( gasps )
Sheesh.
I'm not that crazy.
Powder! Leave her out of this.
Now...
Where should I sit?
That's your choice, really.
Make her go away. Please.
Send her on her way and...
And you can have Powder back.
Mm.
I can't.
Ah.
No! Powder, listen.
We... we can just go.
We'll leave and never come back.
Where would we go?
No, no, no. She's not saying that.
It's true, we'll put this behind us.
You'll never have to see him again, Powder.
What do you have to say about that?
Her name is Jinx!
She's lying.
You'll be with her a day before she realizes you aren't that girl anymore and turns her back on you.
Mm-hmm.
You aren't lying?
You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.
I'm not lying.
I'm on your side. I promise.
Shut up! We're talking!
The topsiders offered me everything.
No!
No...
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
I never would have given you to them.
Not for anything.
But you changed too.
So...
Here's to the new us.
I feel like you and I got off on the wrong arm.
I didn't lose her! They took her.
I'm Not Weak. And I'm Gonna Show Him. Oh, I'm Gonna Show Him. You'll See.
I Thought, Maybe You Could Love Me Like You Used To, Even Though I'm Different.
I thought maybe you could love me like you used to. Even though I'm... different.
