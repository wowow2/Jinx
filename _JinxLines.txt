She already told you.
One of those Firelight wackos was a girl.
With pink hair.
I don't need time!
I've set the building on fire on accident, totally by accident.
Also, I brought this dynamite. Goodbye.
Boring...
Boring. Wow. Super boring...
Here we go!
It's all about these runes.
They form some kind of math-y, magic-y gateway.
To the realm of heebie-jeebies. And this... Turns it on.
So... here goes.
No! It was a mistake! It was a mistake.
Chuck!
Thieram. Uh... My name's Thieram.
Nice try, Chuck.
What's all the hubbub?
Someone? Anyone? Who are you grabbing?
Focus. Who are they? Why wasn't I invited to the party?
Oh really? Which number?
You're doing great, Chuck.
Here, for your troubles.
Vi?
Are you real?
Yes, of course.
Who's she?
Sevika wasn't lying? You're with an enforcer?
This is a trick! You're playing me!
Shut up! I'm in no mood.
Oh, you know. Here, there, chasing down dead ends.
And guess what? They're not all dead.
Don't move, silly. I might hurt you.
But you found out she came back.
You lied.
From what?
Bravo, sis.
Really thought I buried this place.
But I should have known better.Nothing ever stays dead.
for now, Maybe forever.
Wanna know a secret?
Silco thinks he made Jinx, with all his rants and his hard-won lessons.
"Excise your doubts, Jinx."
"Be what they fear, Jinx."
Like everything was the same as when Vander left him.
But he didn't make Jinx.
You did.
You never left.
I always heard you.
Shadows in the streets, prickles on the back of my neck.
Your voice.
Pushing me.
Picking me up when all the colors were black.
You're the reason I'm still alive.
Are we still sisters?
Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back.
Just like he planned to do with me.
All the time saying you abandoned me when he knew the truth.
Liar.
Mm. We're missing someone.
I paid your girlfriend a visit this morning.
I made her a snack.
Sheesh.
I'm not that crazy.
Now...
Where should I sit?
That's your choice, really.
Make her go away. Please.
Send her on her way and...
And you can have Powder back.
Where would we go?
What do you have to say about that?
You aren't lying?
You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.
Shut up! We're talking!
The topsiders offered me everything.
But you changed too.
So...
Here's to the new us.
I feel like you and I got off on the wrong arm.
I didn't lose her! They took her.
I'm Not Weak. And I'm Gonna Show Him. Oh, I'm Gonna Show Him. You'll See.
I Thought, Maybe You Could Love Me Like You Used To, Even Though I'm Different.
I thought maybe you could love me like you used to. Even though I'm... different.
