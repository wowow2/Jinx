      Ah. Come in, Jayce.

      ( door closes )

                    HEIMERDINGER

      Can you believe it?

      Our city is about to turn 200 years old.

      A bicentennial.

      ( chuckles )

      It's shaping up to be an amazing Progress Day.

      "Stanwick Padidly"? Huh, I don't know much about him.

      Everything he built either exploded, melted, or toppled over.

      And yet, here he stands.

      Stanwick set his personal ambitions aside and focused on something far more important.

      Our future.

      He realized nothing he could accomplish could compare to the contributions of his students.

      I had no idea.

                    HEIMERDINGER

      That was his sacrifice.

      A dear friend.

      The Council has recommended you give the Progress Day speech this year.

      What... But you always give that speech.

      ( chuckles ) I... I could never take your place.

      I agree with them.

      Your Hexgates have done wonders for our city.

      Brought scholars from distant lands. Reignited passions in arts and science.

      You deserve this honor.

      ( sighs )

      I... I will do my best to make Piltover proud, Professor.
             HEIMERDINGER

It's short notice, I know, but perhaps there's something in the lab you might be able to share?

People love a grand reveal.

Viktor and I have just the thing. The next chapter of Hextech.

Come to the lab this afternoon, I'll show you.

I'll look forward to it.

You certainly have something to live up to, my boy.

I can only imagine the strings she pulled to have me posted here.

It's your fault really, for not following her into a career "more befitting your station."

( sighs )

She'd do anything to keep me from seeing the real world.

Well, at least you'll have front-row seats to the speech.

Speech?

Mm-hmm. I'm giving the big address tonight.

Hmm. We really have descended to anarchy.

Have fun herding the drunkards.

You think he will approve?

               JAYCE

Heimerdinger believes science should be used to improve lives as much as we do.

We just need to show him it's safe.

And what about the Council?

We stabilized the crystal like they asked.

Built the Hexgates like they asked.

               JAYCE

It's our turn to decide the future of Hextech.

( chitters )

               JAYCE

Professor. I'm so glad you could make it.

Wouldn't miss it for the world, my boy. What do we have on the docket?

               JAYCE

It all began with this.

( twinkles )

               JAYCE

A crystal of magical energy, too volatile to be handled outside our workshops.

Hextech was supposed to bring magic into the life of the common man.

And now, it finally can.

A Hextech Gemstone.

( mysterious music plays )

( Jayce grunts, screams )

( stammers ) Wait.
( Jayce grumbles )

( squeaks )

Holy sprockets.

              VIKTOR

We've found a means to fortify the crystals.

This new version is stable and absolutely safe.

We present to you the next chapter of Hextech.

We can now design portable devices.

Oh...

( grunts ) The Gemstone can power virtually anything.

( powering up )

( suspenseful music plays )

( squeaks )

The Atlas Gauntlets. ( huffs )

The mining colonies in the fissures can work faster and without fatigue.

The Hex Claw.

              VIKTOR

A mechanical arm, equipped with a powerful ray of light.

( zapping )

Imagine what our artificers could do with such a device.

I want Hextech to be a tool for us to build a new world.

And now, it's finally possible.

( whimpers )

Anyway, this is our presentation.

Quite amazing, gentlemen. You should be very proud.

Obviously, there are a few kinks to iron out and screws to be tightened, but give it a decade of careful research, and it will be
ready.

A decade?

Oh, don't worry, my boy. It zips past you in the blink of an eye.

With respect, Professor.

We can be improving lives with Hextech now.

A breakthrough like this takes time, Viktor.

Putting that kind of power into everyone's hands is dangerous.

Keep at it and I'm sure you will discover a way to safeguard Hextech against misuse.

Easy.

She shot me.

Who shot you? Who were you working for?

I can't. He'll kill me.

Who?

( groans )

              CAITLYN

I can protect you.

              MARCUS

Caitlyn Kiramman, why does that not surprise me?

Interfering in an investigation, again.

You're supposed to be guarding your mother's tent.

I was, Sheriff, but she doesn't need it. And clearly, this takes priority.

I realize you're used to getting your way, Kiramman, but we have a chain of command for a reason.

              CAITLYN

I understand.

But there's more going on here than just the smuggling.

If I could just question him I could...

              MARCUS

I'll take it from here.

Since you're looking for more work, you can take the graveyard shift tonight at the fair.

Yes, sir.

Good.

I want this one on a boat to Stillwater prison.

Yes, sir.

              SILCO

There are always mishaps in battle.

The Firelights were her target and most are dead.
It wasn't a mishap, she froze up and lost her sh¡t.

I could've handled those brats.

She's a problem and we all know it.

             SILCO

We?

Who's we?

I expect better from you than excuses.

It was your job to make sure things went smoothly.

You failed. Don't disappoint me again.

( grunts )

( door opens, closes )

( sighs )

The world's growing smaller every day, thanks to the Hexgates.

And now, we're cut off.

The topsiders are leaving us further and further behind.

What happened?

             JINX

She already told you.

I'm asking you.

( object thuds )

             JINX

One of those Firelight wackos was a girl.

With pink hair.

             SILCO

Hmm...

Your sister's gone.

You know that as well as I do.

I know. I know. Sisters, right? (chuckles )

You can't live with 'em, can't stuff 'em back in the ol' babymaker.

( chuckles, huffs )

Today's screw-up will set us back weeks.

I'm sorry.

I need to know that I can rely on you.

Phew.

I'm doing this for us, Jinx. All of us.

The sons and daughters of Zaun deserve more than their runoff.

It won't happen again.

             SILCO

I know.

( grunts )
( heaving )

( Silco sighs )

Sevika will clean up today's mess.

Sevika? That ogre couldn't clean a dust bunny with a blowtorch.

She'll suffice. You should focus on your gadgetry.

               JINX

Ugh.

Take some time.

( stammers ) I don't need time.

Take it anyhow.

               ELORA

Your mother would be proud.

Hmm... Would she?

               ELORA

Tired of mingling?

               MEL

Hmm. These people have nothing new to offer me.

The only one actually worth my time is him.

The golden boy.

( Elora chuckles )

Ah, he's won Piltover's heart.

Oh, speak of the devil.

Could I borrow you for a minute?

               MEL

To what do I owe the pleasure?

It's Heimerdinger.

               MEL SCOFFS

When is it not?
             JAYCE

We've shown him our research.

He thinks we need more time.

It's Progress Day.

Representatives from all over the world have come to see what new wonders the City of Progress has to offer.

If there's a time to present a new creation, it is now.

( sighs )

Great.

( chuckles )

Heimerdinger is a great scientist. But he's old. He only ever sees the past.

Piltover needs a leader who looks forward.

Someone like you.

You really believe that?

Hextech has the potential to change everything.

The world is ready.

And I've already spoken to several potential investors.

Investors?

Of course.

( chuckling ) Everyone wants Hextech for themselves.

It's your speech.

Give the people a glimpse of the future.

( chilling music plays )

( bats chitter )

( creacking )

It wasn't her.

It wasn't.

I know. Just... just some wannabe street trash.

I got confused, that's all.

Now, he thinks I'm weak.

"Sevika will clean it up."

Sevika's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.

I'm not weak.

And I'm gonna show him.

Oh, I'm gonna show him. You'll see.

( explosion )

( crowd cheer )

( coughs )

( approaching footsteps )

Where were you?

They were asking if I could do the address.
You should come up with me. We're partners.

No, no. Not in front of all of them...

You... have your speech prepared?

Uh-huh.

            MRS. KIRAMMAN

An inspiration to Piltover's future and that of all humanity.

Please join me in welcoming to the stage...

Jayce Talis.

Guess it's time.

( crowd applaud )

( grand music plays )

( crowd cheering )

( crowd whistling )

Uh, good evening.

I know many of you probably didn't expect to see me here today.

And believe me, I'm just as shocked as you are.

( crowd applaud )

My family and I are simple people. In our factory, we made hammers.

They were probably used to cut the stones you're standing on right now.

No one in my life expected very much of me.

And that is precisely what makes this moment so extraordinary.

A few years ago, the Hexgates opened their ports to the world and made Piltover prosper beyond anything we could have ever
imagined.

( crowd cheer )

( man whistles )

But... we're not done yet.

( mysterious music plays )

This year, we've created something new for you.

Something that... um...

( mic feedbacks )

That we will share with you...

( crowd mutter )

...when the time is right.

( crowd exclaim )

( crowd mutter )

Things that will bring an end to your hardships.

Whether you're the scion of our high houses, or an honest laborer from the underground.

We vow to keep pressing forward, for we are the City of Progress.

And our future is bright.

( crowd cheer )

( fireworks crackle )
( gasps )

                DUTY CAPTAIN

That it, then?

I thought that Talis boy was some kind of genius.

Last year, didn't he launch a blimp halfway across the continent?

                CAITLYN

Airship, actually.

An airship has a rigid metal hull. It's not a blimp.

It's a balloon, ain't it?

Sure as hell looks that way.

Pardon us, if we aren't quite so refined as you, milady.

                FEMALE ENFORCER

What are you even doing here, Kiramman?

Don't you have a cocktail party to attend?

Fire.

Fire!

Help. It's so hot, please. I'm trapped.

I'm a helpless little girl and I've set the building on fire.

The Gemstone is gone. Along with some of our research papers.

             MARCUS

The situation is still developing. No one in the undercity has claimed responsibility yet.

How did it come to this?

Hmm. For too long has the underground been left unchecked.

             SHOOLA

We've lost touch.

They may not be your preferred constituents but they're still our people.

The undercity cannot be controlled. Not by us.

So where does that leave us?

( Bolbok mutters )

             BOLBOK

Mr. Talis?

Could the trenchers build a weapon with the stolen crystal?

             HOSKEL

Shimmer, body replacements...

We've seen their ingenuity over the years, of course, they can.

If the right person got a hold of it, it's possible they could utilize its energy.

We need to address this immediately.

I agree.

It was my responsibility to safeguard this technology and I failed.

My mistake cost people their lives.

I have come before you to recommend that we suspend all Hextech operations until the situation is resolved.

Including our laboratories, the refinery and the Hexgates.

Have you lost your mind?

             SHOOLA

The Hexgates must remain open.

Piltover's status as a global shipping lane depends on it.

Thousands would lose their income.

But shouldn't the safety of Piltover be our first priority?

You would sacrifice your life's work?

Without the Hexgates, my goods cannot reach foreign markets till winter.

Am I to tell the Noxians their next shipment of wine will be vinegar?

             MEL

Councilors. It appears we are at an impasse.

If we shut down the Hexgates, the city will suffer.

But if we do nothing, we leave ourselves vulnerable to malefactors.

More lives may be lost.

Perhaps the time has come to explore a more radical solution.

What are you suggesting?
Mr. Talis has demonstrated his commitment to our safety.

He's willing to sacrifice his own enterprise.

And it seems to me only Mr. Talis has the knowledge necessary to secure the Hexgates.

I propose that a new chair be brought forth, and that House Talis be elevated to this august body.

What?

               MEL

As a Councilor, he will have the resources necessary to protect all our investments.

Councilor Medarda, his is highly irregular.

The Council has held seven seats for generations.

               BOLBOK

Does the boy have any experience?

Only that of a scientist. Like Heimerdinger.

( sighs )

I believe Councilor Medarda is right.

Hextech security should be administered by a scientist.

I second the motion.

               MEL

Well then, shall we vote?

Hey.

How are you feeling?

I've had a break in the case.

Shouldn't you be resting?

While the trail is hot?

Listen, you know how I've suspected there is a single mind behind the undercity's violence?

The great conspiracy.

I think whoever attacked the square is our suspect.

The same symbols showed up at the botched smuggling operation at the Hexgates.

The Hexgates?

Keep up.

All this time, they've kept their dealings localized to the undercity.

Low priority. The attack on the square changes things.

They've overstepped.

If I can figure who made this, it could lead me directly to whoever's behind it all.

The answer is here, staring me in the face.

             CAITLYN

I can feel it.

How do you intend to prove any of this?

If I can just work this out. Marcus will have to listen.

             JAYCE

If there's one thing I've learned about the Council, they need more than just theories.

Since when did you concern yourself with the Council's opinion?

Since I... became a Councilor.

( chuckles )

You're serious.

When? Why?

Have they discovered how to govern with grease and a spanner?

Ha ha. I was actually hoping you might consider joining my staff.

             CAITLYN

"House Talis Security."

That's a ceremonial position. I'd live behind a desk.

You almost died, Cait.

I just... I just want you to be safe.

Thanks, but I already have a job.

No. You don't.

You attacked an inmate. Why?

Why not?

He was a witness in an ongoing investigation.

               VI

Hmm, bummer.

( sighs ) This was a waste of time.

Couldn't have put it better.

Hey, give Silco a kiss on that winning eye of his, will you?

( sighs )

Silco? The industrialist?

Okay, this is getting old.

Can you just send in whoever's gonna kick the sh¡t out of me, so I can get on with my night?

( sighs )

Does this mean anything to you?

( suspenseful music plays )

( gasps )

Where did you get this?

( exhales )

My question first. He worked for Silco?

Uh, they all do.

How can anyone not know that? Where did you find this?

There was an attack. This is evidence.

I need proof if I'm to believe what you're saying about Silco.

( scoffs )

I could get it for you. Just not from in here.

( snickers )

In what mad world would I trust someone like you?

Someone like me?

You enforcers are all the same. Just asshоlе criminals in fancy uniforms.

You know what? Find Silco yourself.
I will, thank you.

Hmm... Undercity's gonna eat you alive.

( breathes deeply )

I've got orders from Councilor Talis, concerning Inmate 516.

( chuckles ) Not cooperative, huh?

You, uh, you want us to have a chat with her?

No.

Oh.

It's for her release.

Huh. Since when's he a Councilor?

Since today.

( scoffs )

How many chats have you had with her?

You know, I never even thought to count.

She pushed it too far this time. The Council's up in arms.

I need you to do your job.

The Firelights have been a thorn in both our sides.

It seems to me the Council has its culprit.

Oh, that's tidy for you.

What if I'm not interested in playing along?

We've accomplished a lot together, Marcus. Sheriff.

And there is more yet to achieve.

I hope you can remain a part of it.

For their families. From an anonymous, concerned citizen.

This is a poor use of our time.

I'm a Councilor now, Viktor.

It's my responsibility to make sure the Hexgates are safe and protected.

What about our pledge to improve lives, for those in need? For the undercity?

( sighs )

Look, I'm sorry I didn't announce our other projects in my speech.

Soon, we can do everything we...

Soon?

There are people who need our help now, Jayce.

             MARCUS

You wanted to see me?

Have your people ever reviewed these logs?

Mr. Talis, I assure you...
Councilor.

And the only assurance I need is that you will search and seize any unauthorized merchandise.

I've made a list of suspicious transactions.

All due respect, Councilor, today's your first day...

Second.

( stammers ) Right.

You sure you don't want to confer with the other Councilors before...

               JAYCE

This corruption runs deep, Sheriff.

I intend to root it out.

Have you made any progress with the stolen Gemstone?

Yes. Chief suspect is an undercity gang.

( coughing )

               MARCUS

They call themselves the Firelights.

They operate like phantoms, doing hit-and-runs on civilians and disappearing into the night.

How soon till we track them down?

We've been trying to discover runes that invoke specific effects and then molding them to a useful function.

Tools, as you like to put it. But, but...
If the legends are true, mages aren't bound to single functions.

It's said the Arcane speaks through them.

I'm still not following.

You think Hextech can... learn?

Are you sure this is safe?

Of course not.

Are you going to question him?

About what? The meat?

Definitely not above board.

Silco. His connections? Isn't that why we're here?

We're here because I'm hungry. Do you know what prison food is like?

No, of course, you don't.

Unbelievable. I didn't break you out of jail to eat... slop.

I knew this was a terrible idea. You don't actually know anything, do you?

Mm. Better than I remember.

Since my parents brought me for the winter fest.

We're not here for the performance. Your House is in trouble.

That merchant formerly enjoyed certain leniencies with regard to her trade in exchange for her generous Academy patronage.

By leniencies you mean corruption?

Hmm, Amara's harmless.

Oh, look at those two stooges.
Councilors Hoskel and Salo. Don't they hate each other?

Hmm. But they share a taste for the finer Noxian spirits, technically an illegal import.

I tightened our security.

And in so doing, put a target on your back.

There are those who covet your power over the wealth the Hexgates afford.

And would take any opportunity to seize it from you.

You've just made yourself everyone's common enemy, Jayce.

I can't compromise the safety of the Hexgates for collateral.

No one's asking you to. These are simply favors amongst friends.

I never wanted anything to do with politics. You pushed this on me.

You're a symbol of the future now, Jayce, whether you like it or not.

With that comes the potential to shape your own destiny.

The Council assumes you'll fail. Time to prove them all wrong. Once again.

             MEL

Welcome, Amara. How's little Rohan?

             AMARA

Councilor Medarda. Councilor Talis.

( Amara and Mel chuckle )

I had quite a shock this morning. Enforcers banging on my door.

             MEL

Oh, I hope you'll understand, Jayce had to make a show of safety.

But he's here now to negotiate all his deals personally.

Councilor Talis is willing to reinstate former trade privileges to those who share his vision.

Can we count you amongst them?

Councilor Bolbok seems to think other arrangements would be more profitable.

( scoffs ) The man's a fool.

With him, you'd be investing in the past.

With us, you'd be investing in the future.

( breathes sharply )

You know, Councilor Medarda's right. The Hexgates are only the beginning.

In fact, we're currently looking for new partners in our Hextech research, and as a supporter of House Talis, you'd be the first in line
to any of our advancements.
( playing violin continues )

How can I say no to such an auspicious offer?

Hextech partners?

Has a nice ring, doesn't it?

Would you believe it?

( indistinct chatter )

Sheriff, what a lovely surprise.

The Hextech wonder boy is on the Council now, and he's asking questions.

It's only a matter of time before he finds the truth.

What is truth, but a survivor's story?

If I'm discovered, we're both finished.

Good thing you've located proof of the Firelights' involvement.

This has gone too far.

Hmm? Imagining yourself a hero?

I can't do it. Just... give it to the doctor.
You're the only one I can trust with this, Jinx.

I keep... seeing them. That day.

Fear haunts us all, child.

Sweetheart, I was real sad to hear about Vander.

And the kids. Just terrible.

By the looks of it, no one down here lifted a finger to stop Silco.

A few tried but Silco's got the muscle... and the money.

He took over the Last Drop.

I saw.

Things have changed without Vander looking out for us.

Have you heard anything about Powder? I think Silco has her.

I have to find her.

Silco's number two's a regular.

I can have Miguel tell you where to find her.

I owe you.

It's nothing.

I had a good teacher.

It's only a matter of time before those old fools on the Council officially accept your research.

My father put hammers in the hands of the people, and they built this magnificent city.

Imagine the wonders they could create if we put magic in their hands.

The world will never be the same.

The Medardas usually only take from the world.

Vander wasn't the man you thought he was.

Right, he was like a brother to you, and he turned his back and blah, blah, blah.

Did I miss anything?

( snickers ) I've got a new one for you.

( water dripping )

That day, I let a weak man die.

( water sloshing )

And another was reborn.

Betrayal, that pain that feels like it'll eat you from the inside out, can either break you or forge you into something greater.

You need to let Powder die.

So the fear of pain will no longer control you.

You're strong now. Just like you were always meant to be.

You're lying! ( breathes angrily )

( chuckles ) Why bother?

Her back in town, it's only a matter of time before you implode and Silco finally gets the message that you're about as good for our
cause as you were for your family.

( hisses )

Jinx.

( sobs )

( sneezes )

( grunts )

( giggles ) Ten outta ten, toots!

I think I know just how to deliver that message.

Ah, about time Daddy joined us.

You were so busy, little Ren here saw me in.

( gasps )

( exhales )

( chuckles )

Let's talk outside.

Can't you see we're playing?

You remember our old friend Vi, don't you?

Vander's daughter. She was about your age.

Her father went on a long trip and Daddy here assured me that she left with him.

( gulps )

But it seems she never made it. Isn't that sad?

Could you imagine being separated from your father?

( gasps )

She's... in a safe place.

She's in the Lanes.

That's not possible.

There's an enforcer with her. A girl. Roughly the same age.

Caitlyn. She's a Kiramman. Just like them, she does whatever she wants.

I... can't control her.

Then of what use are you?

I'll track her down.
I can fix this.

Please.

Everyone makes mistakes, right?

What's important is that we don't repeat them.

My people are tracking Vi and this...

( scoffs )

...Caitlyn. They cannot be allowed to resurface.

              SILCO

Do we understand each other?

Hmm.

( chuckles )

( gasps )

Hmm.

Oops. Ah. So sorry. Accidents happen.

Watch.

It responds to organic matter.

              JAYCE

Incredible.

This is unlike anything we've ever seen, Jayce.

It, it, it could be the key to augmenting physiology, extending life...

Curing you.

( squeals )

( rumbles )

It's happened to everyone.

I can't determine why.

They're... rejecting the transmutation.

( solemn music )

( sighs )

We'll solve this.

There may not be time.

We're in uncharted waters here and...

I can feel my body... eroding.

I'll have Sky bring Heimerdinger. He might know something that could help.

In the meantime, we'll do what we do best.

It was never this big, though.

There.

( exhales )

( ominous music continues )

I know you have your reservations about me, but this only works if we can trust each other.

It doesn't work. It never has.

You topsiders always find a way to screw us.

I suppose topside is to blame for all your misfortunes.

( Powder hums )

              VI

No.

Not all of them.

We aren't monsters, you know. We're people, just like you.

You don't know anything about me.

( quivers )

I shouldn't have left you.

It's all right. Despite it all, I can tell... you have a good heart.

( exhales )

              VANDER

You've got a good heart.

What is that?

I'm calling it the Hexcore.

It's an adaptive rune matrix. Hextech that evolves.

( gibbers )

( stammers ) It's groundbreaking.
               JAYCE

What's most exciting is that it reacts to biological matter.

There are stories of healing magic. Our samples thus far have perished...

( suspenseful music )

( explosion )

You must destroy it.

What?

Please, if ever you've put faith in my guidance, hear me now.

I've seen nations destroyed by a single seed and it looked... exactly like this.

Professor, this could save Viktor's life.

Viktor, something's different. You've changed. What did you do?

( stammers ) What do you mean, Professor?

It's that thing. It must be destroyed!

Wait.

No. I won't let you.

( barks )

Jayce, this is a violation of the Ethos.

I will have it destroyed one way or another.

That's your opinion. We'll see if the Council agrees.

( pet coos )

( barks )

( groans )

I might know someone else who could help.

You do what you have to. I need to get ready.

For what?

( exhales )

( breathes deeply )

Is she all right?

( gasps )

Wait, wait, wait! Easy. Easy.

( stammers ) That's Vi, right?

( stutters ) I'm a friend.

( gasps )

Or at least I was. I mean, I... I owed her old man my life.

Probably more than that.

I guess.

She's bleeding. She needs a doctor.

( laughs )

Not so simple to come by around here. (laughs nervously )

Hey.
( both grunt )

I'm sorry.

Oh, oh. But, ah, I do know someone else who might be able to help.

( clears throat ) Come with me.

( chimes )

( gasps, clears throat )

( door opens )

( snarls ) Ailment?

Uh...

Uh... she's been stabbed.

( exhales )

( snarls )

She makes potions.

Helps people here with... ( gasps ) ...with this.

Shimmer. Why would you take something that does that to you?

I just... wanted to feel what it was like...

To be somebody. To make other people afraid.

Instead of...

( snarls )

( apothecary grunts )

Thank you, I really...

( door bangs )

Let's go. I think Vi will be happy to see a friendly face.

( stammers ) No, no. You go ahead.

She knew me when I was still...

Anyway, I don't want her to see me like this.

Just tell her, uh, tell her I'm sorry. About everything.

Okay? ( grunts )

( exhales )

( dramatic music )

I found this on one of the Firelights.

It matches fragments we found outside your lab and at the Hexgates.
I... have reason to believe they're planning more attacks.

Well, how has this threat gone unnoticed for so long?

Since the Hexgates were completed, the fissures haven't been a priority.

Oh, we'll settle that later. For now, we need to prevent any further attacks.

Short of searching everyone who crosses the bridges.

I don't know how we can.

Then, that's what we'll do.

Are you certain? This sort of an order...

Do it. We have to protect the city.

One other thing.

I saw Caitlyn Kiramman had a prisoner released on your order.

Is there anything I can assist with?

           JAYCE

No. No, uh, we've got it covered.

           HEIMERDINGER

Councilors, we have lost our way.

This city was founded to be a bastion of enlightenment.

In a world that cannibalized itself over power and pride.

But we've forgotten.

Loosened our morals in favor of comfort and convenience.

Traded honor for prestige.

We were once one tribe.

Now we are Houses divided.

I believe, if we set aside our greed and arrogance, we can be one again.

It will take vigilance. We must hold each other accountable.

And who holds you accountable?

           HEIMERDINGER

What?

           JAYCE

Shimmer is rampant in the undercity.

Attacks at the Hexgates and in the Academy Square.

Enforcers fear to set foot in the Lanes. All under your watch.

Jayce, you forget yourself.

I'm sorry, Professor, but healing this city will take more than just speeches.

Time and again, you've warned us what not to do.

But let me ask you this, what's your plan to fix this?

I see what this is about.

Your Hextech projects need more time. More safeguards.

Humans don't live for centuries. We can't wait for progress.

We need a leadership focused on the future, not the past.
You are the true Father of Piltover, and your years of service can never be repaid.

I believe it's time we gave the beloved founder of our city... a well-deserved retirement.

Jayce, don't do this.

Hmm.

( breathes heavily )

( slurps )

               JAYCE

It has to be unanimous. All in favor?

( sighs )

With my deepest respect and appreciation, Professor.

We're going to have to be more careful now.

You used to live here?

Who's Powder?

My sister. I thought she died, but, no.
I have to try and find her.

How do you not know if your sister is alive or dead?

It's hard to check up on people from inside a concrete cell.

What, you don't have parents?

No! They were killed by enforcers.

I've freed her.

Candidly, I thought you were the prize of your secondhand family.

But Jinx...

( man 2 growls )

Oh. She is more than I ever imagined.

( mysterious music )

I'm gonna find her and erase whatever fucked-up delusions you put in her head.

              VI

But first, I'm gonna bring your bullshit empire down all around you.

( Caitlyn grunts )

You don't know your limits, girl. It's what got Vander killed.

What drove your sister away. And it's why I'm here right now.

I just... I never thought I'd see you again.

Are you real?

Yes, of course. It's me, Vi, your sister.

( stammers ) I'm here. I'm right here.

Caitlyn, just listen, we can work this out.

This is a trick! You're playing me!

Shut up! I'm in no mood.

            CAITLYN

We didn't say anything.

I wasn't talking to you!

Powder, it's okay.

Stop calling me that.

It's Jinx now. Powder fell down a well.

You're not a jinx.

God, I never should have...

Stop talking to me like I'm a child!

Was that why you came?

For this stupid stone? ( chuckles )

No, I don't even know what that is, I...

Sister. Thought I missed her. Bet you wouldn't miss her.

We understand.

Just stand down!

( distant shouting continues )

Thank you for alerting me, Sheriff.

             MARCUS

Not a problem, Councilor.

Jayce, what is this?

( background clamoring )

Do you have any idea how this looks?

I order a blockade and my own partner violates it?

You ordered this? Why?

There are people down there who seem hell-bent on destroying us.

What were you doing?

I was consulting a friend about our quandary.

I told you, I knew someone.

Well, you didn't say they were from the undercity.

             VIKTOR
What difference does that make?

What diff... They're dangerous.

I'm from the undercity.

              JAYCE

You're right.

I'm sorry.

I've had a lot on my plate.

Was your friend able to help?

No.

No, he said, "Nature was resistant to this sort of tampering."

All right, we'll keep at it.

              FINN

First, this wild attack in the heart of Piltover.

Now, the border's closing.

We're bleeding money and for what?

His dreams of rebellion? He's losing control.

If we stand together...

              SILCO

We aren't due for an assembly.

( door closes )

We should be.

Ever since your stunt topside, profits have been plummeting.

He's right. Merchandise is frozen at the border.

Topsiders are too afraid to cross.

We're all wondering, what's your plan to fix this?

You're all wondering, are you?

Way I see it, we should cut a deal and give back the Gemstone.

              FINN

Better to have some trade than none at all.

The border issue is temporary. Jinx will deal with it.

Huh. ( laughs )

Rumor is, your dog's off her leash.

How you meant to bring Piltover to heel if you can't handle your own people, huh?

             SILCO

But I pulled you all up from the depths.

( coughing )

Offered you a taste of topside.

And fresh air.

I gave you life.

Purpose.

( coughing )

But you've grown fat and complacent.

Too much time in the sun.

( coughing continues )

We came from a world where there was never enough to go around, Finn.

You're...

But I thought you... I thought they were hurting you!

Vi tells me I can trust you.

              EKKO
You get a pass back topside, that's it.

Let's go.

              JINX

Let me help you with that.

( grunts )

Where've you been, Jinx?

Oh, you know. Here, there, chasing down dead ends.

And guess what? They're not all dead.

I can explain.

( groans )

Don't move, silly. I might hurt you.

I didn't know. Marcus never told me she was in Stillwater.

( grumbles )

But you found out she came back.

You lied.

( pierces )

( Silco grunts )

I wanted to protect you.

From what?

She and the enforcer are back for the crystal. Not for you.

( exhales )

Have you forgotten how she left you?

Who found you? Who cared for you? Gave you a home?

I am your family. Everyone else betrays us.

( Jinx whimpers )

              SILCO

I need you.

( Jinx sobs )

              SILCO

Now more than ever.

You have to complete the weapon.

( birds chirping )

It's beautiful.

If your people had your way, it'd be rubble and ash.

It's a misunderstanding.

They think you work for Silco.

Your people hunt us like animals. Silco pays them to do it.

That's not possible. You're wrong.

Say that one more time.

Ekko, she believes what she's saying, okay? She's not your enemy.

( scoffs ) Oh, yeah? Then what's this?

( object trills )

You got it. You have to let me take that back.

( sighs )

What is it?

It's a Gemstone.

It was stolen during the attack. By your sister.

You just forgot to mention that?

With this, someone with the right knowledge could build... any Hextech device.

If enforcers are becoming more... aggressive, that's why.

We could beat Silco with this.

That won't solve things.

Easy for you to say. Your people aren't dying all around you.

Ekko, it's wrong what's been done to you.

              CAITLYN

You'd be well within your rights to keep it.

I couldn't blame you.

But... if you do, this cycle of violence will never stop.

This is our best shot at setting the record straight.

This city needs healing.

More than I ever realized.

Please, let me help you.

You got a plan?

I have a friend on the council.

Let me take the Gemstone to him.

              CAITLYN

He'll listen to me. Your people wouldn't have to hide anymore.

One condition. I'm the one who gives it to them.

Um, the form is crude, but... uh, the engineering is... inspired.

You think they could crack Hextech?

Mm. It's a leap.
It's been suggested that they may have found a way to utilize the Gemstone.

If we are to assume the worst, that would mean they've turned it into a weapon.

Well, do we know this for certain?

We can't afford to wait to find out.

Wait. What are you suggesting?

We should prepare our own countermeasures.

You want us to build weapons?

Absolutely not. That is not why we invented Hextech.

              JAYCE

We would shatter any attempt at peace.

Heimerdinger would never go for this.

Heimerdingers' inaction is what brought us here. You said so yourself.

The peace is already broken, Jayce.

I'm only asking you to prepare to defend your people.

              MEL

If we're lucky, we'll never need to use it.

( scoffs, sighs )

The decision is yours.

( scoffs )

( sighs )

( sighs )

              VIKTOR

Ridiculous. You cannot be considering this.

What if she's right? Are we just gonna stand by while they attack us?

We're scientists, not soldiers.

We have the knowledge to defend ourselves.

We agreed Hextech was to improve lives...

( stammers ) ...not to take them.

We may not have a choice.

                   WOMAN

      When I was ten, your grandfather brought me to the aftermath of the Battle of Hildenard.

      He offered me a gold coin for every blade I retrieved from the fallen.

      Said we needed the steel.

      But I knew it was a lie.

      He wanted me to know death.

      Kino says war is a failure of statecraft.

                   WOMAN

      Your brother thinks he can talk his way out of anything.

      He fancies himself a fox among the wolves.

      But mark me, child, if you want to last in this world, you must learn to be both the fox and the wolf.

                   YOUNG MEL

      We'll paint the walls in gold.

      Import crystal chandeliers.

      Advisors will enter here, but the regent will have her own, secret entrance.

      She should have a kind, fat face.

      Clever, to charm her subjects, but pliable so we can mold her.

                   WOMAN

      Perhaps, she could be my daughter.

      You'd give me a throne?

In private.

               CAITLYN

You have to speak to the Council.

Speak to the Council?

You understand you've broken several laws?

She was doing what she thought was right.

( groans )

I'll take responsibility.

You're a Councilor's daughter.

Your actions reflect on the entire body.

My actions? ( grumbles )

You know what else reflects on the Council?

Its citizens living on the streets. Being poisoned.

Having to choose between a kingpin who wants to exploit them and a government that doesn't give a sh¡t.

"Sevika's out in the harbor," or "Sevika paid the knuckleheads a visit."

You're a scary lady.

Get to your point.

Run a tight ship, don't you?

Except it's not your ship.

It's his and Jinx's.

This is your plan?

Undermine Silco by making a half-assed play at my ego?

Gotta hand it to you, Finn.

Every time I think you can't get dumber, you dig a new low.

Let's be plain, then. He's slipping.

The undercity's devolving to chaos.

And somehow, I get the feeling he isn't up there balancing booksheets.

And here you are, shoveling his sh¡t.

( chuckles )

You didn't sail halfway across the continent to sample the local cuisine.
It's been over a decade, Mel.

Since you banished me?

Such drama.

I sent you here to oversee our family's interests and grow yourself.

Which you have.

You said, "Perhaps, your sentimentality will be more at home with those soft-spined idealists overseas."

You have your father's memory.

Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me.

Mel.

Or that.

( seagulls caw )

Your brother's gone.

( gasps )

What happened?

( sighs ) He crossed the wrong man.

I was distracted.

That's a mistake I can't take back.

( heavy breathing )

Your Jayce Talis has turned his eye to Hextech weaponry.

( scoffs ) I knew it.

War is coming.

You've let the problems of your undercity fester too long.

Piltover isn't like Noxus.

War isn't our first and every recourse.

I sponsored Hextech to protect the city, not burn it to the ground.

It's not conjecture, it's a fact.

Weapons can't be unmade and they are always used.

I'm here to help guide you to the right decisions.

I don't need your guidance.

We'll see.

Miss Medarda?

Yes?

Yes?

He's for me, dear.

I'm off to sample the local cuisine.

( seagulls caw )

( door opens )

We'll present our case to the Council tonight.

You did all this yourself?

Without even going down there?
( Vi sighs )

And I thought Powder could get obsessed. (scoffs )

What happened to her, it's not your fault.

When my parents were still alive... me and Powder used to share a bed like this.

Except, maybe, half the size.

We played a game where we pretended to be bigger and bigger monsters.

So she would say, "I'm a slug monster with venom for ooze."

And I'd say, "Well, I'm a slug-eating crab with razor spikes."

Sometimes, I... I'd get carried away and she'd get scared.

I didn't want her to start crying and wake my parents up, so...

I pretended to chase my own monsters away.

I'd say...

"No monster's gonna get you when I'm here."

Then a real monster showed up.

And I just ran away.

I left her.

It's, um, Councilor Talis.

              MRS. MEDARDA

The Alornian General Sonnem Parlec used to find ways to meet his enemies blindfolded.

He said a man's mind hides behind his body.

Somehow, I doubt he ever tried this.

You're Mel's mom.

Among other things.

              MRS. MEDARDA

Squeeze, child. You won't break it.

I do have other matters, so if you'll excuse me...

              MRS. MEDARDA

The threat of the undercity is real.

Your leadership is impotent.

( scoffs )

We may not be Noxus, but Piltover isn't as helpless as you think.
             MRS. MEDARDA

Who said anything about Piltover?

The Council is the problem. The mind hiding behind the body.

Navigating your current crisis requires expertise you lack.

Do you know what the success rate for senior Academy inventors is?

             JAYCE

Three percent.

We're no strangers to failure.

What makes this the City of Progress is that we keep trying until we get it right.

So thank you for your advice, Mrs. Medarda, but I have a city to run.

Wait.

( water sloshes )

( gasps, clears throat )

             MRS. MEDARDA

I see why this province and my daughter have fallen for you.

You have the passion of youth.

I have experience.

I want you to succeed here, Jayce, to grace the world with Hextech.

But if you don't accept certain realities, I fear you'll end up like General Parlec.

Slaughtered with your eyes closed.

             COUNCILOR 1

Three of my suppliers have said they intend to delay shipments until fall to give things "time to cool off."

             MRS. KIRAMMAN

We have greater concerns than a dip in profits.

The Sheriff betrayed us. We need better information.

We need to act. Before anyone else gets killed.

Perhaps Marcus was operating independently.

What could anyone in the undercity offer him that he didn't have up here?

It's not what they offered him, it's what he had to lose.

Councilors, my daughter has a unique insight into our situation.

Thank you.

Councilors, this is Vi. She was born in the undercity.

Even though we failed her in countless ways, she risked everything to show me what life is really like down there.

People are starving, sick, ravaged by Shimmer.

             CAITLYN

They live in constant fear of the coordinated efforts of violent crime lords.

One man leads these efforts.

Silco.

We've done investigations of Silco.
They yielded no such level of organization.

And who led these investigations?

What does this Silco even want from us?

He believes the undercity should be independent.

He calls it the Nation of Zaun.

No, well...

Uh...

Her name is Jinx.

               JAYCE

This Jinx has the Gemstone?

Then we have to go in by force.

That could trigger war.

There are good people down there.

               COUNCILOR 1

Hmph. Bad ones too.

               COUNCILOR 2

Even if we wanted to invade, they have Shimmer.

We have Hextech.

What happened to you?

We've been talking about talking for weeks now.

They're still cleaning the blood off the bridge.

When do we say enough is enough?

Jayce, you don't know war.

I do.

It must be our last resort. There may be a diplomatic solution.

She's right.

( grunts )

( sighs )

What? You want to negotiate with him?

               MRS. KIRAMMAN

It may be the only way to avoid further bloodshed.

               VI

This is insane. Did you learn nothing?

You can't talk to him!

He hates you. Everything you stand for.

He will never back down.

Enforcers, please escort them out.

Vi! Wait!

Wait! Where are you going?

I don't know. Back where I came from?

Seems like that's what everyone up here wants.

I can fix this.

You can't!

              VI

This is how things are. How they've always been.

I was so stupid to think it could change.

              CAITLYN

There must be something else we can do. Some other way.

We'll make a new plan. We have to try.

We tried. Okay? It wasn't enough.

Topside and bottom. Oil and water. That's all there is.

What about us?

Oil and water.

Wasn't meant to be.

( sighs )

You're just saying that.

No.

( Vi scoffs )

So you just wave an arm, have someone dragged off, don't bother to find out what it does to someone being stuffed in a stone box
for weeks, or months, or even years?

( sighs )

Yeah. I want to make Silco pay.

                VI

I want in.

There is no in.

You heard the Council.

You said you were tired of doing nothing.

Shut down his supply, and it's only a matter of time before his own people turn on him.

Too bad Jinx didn't think so.

We'll buy another.

You gonna do anything about that piece of sh¡t that murdered my boy?

Let me guess, "Jinx will take care of it."

Just like she's been taking care of everything else.

We all mourn the loss of your son, Renni.

At least, we have the solace of knowing he died fighting for our cause, instead of some petty personal dispute, as so often occurs
here.

You're one to talk about sacrificing for the cause.

Where is Jinx anyhow?

Get ahold of yourself. I taught you better.

( Mrs. Medarda gulps )

( metal clanks )

              MRS. MEDARDA

We're in trouble, Mel.

The man who killed your brother doesn't believe the score is settled, and his resources exceed ours.

If there is a chance Hextech can be weaponized, we must have it.

Piltover isn't your testing ground.

I've only accelerated the process you started.

I wanted to protect the city from people like you.

I can't believe you'd start a war just to cover your ass.
I would set the world ablaze to protect our family.

No.

I stopped being part of this family the moment you cast me out.

Why? Why did you do it?

Because you weakened me!

I couldn't endure the look in your eyes whenever I made the decisions, the necessary decisions to keep us safe!

( solemn music )

We need that weapon, Mel.

Let the war unfold.

And you come home, take your place at my side.

It's where you belong.

I thought a loose cog was gonna take someone's eye out.

At least, you didn't throw up.

Everything made sense then.

              VIKTOR

You have to destroy it.

I know.

The Hexcore.

I... I can't do it.

You have to. Please.

What about your disease?

Without the Hexcore...

Promise me.

Okay. Okay.

I promise.

We lost ourselves. Lost our dream.

In the pursuit of great, we failed to do good.

We have to make it right.

I'm busy.

When you took Vander out of play, I thought, "Now here's a man who understands what it takes to run an enterprise."

The attitude, the instinct, the eye.

The whole package, you were.

Always two steps ahead.

             FINN

But time's lapped you, old man.

You're with him, are you?

You screwed up, Silco.

You're too young to remember what the undercity was before it became an "enterprise".

We had nothing.

             SILCO

You know what bore us through those times?

( sighs )

Loyalty.

Brothers and sisters back-to-back against whatever the world threw at us.

Now I'm forced to share the air with parasites like you, who leach off their legacies.

Today's the day you die, Silco.

That's a risk I've known all my life.

But I still believe in loyalty.

The threats beyond our walls.

This city has a short memory.

"Progress."

Far be it from me to stand in the way.

( dramatic music )

( Silco scoffs )

"Free trade routes, blanket amnesty, unrestricted access to the Hexgates, sovereignty."

Do you really think you're in a position to demand all this?

I give you credit for your stunt, boy.

Didn't think you had the stomach.

But the big display followed by a request for parley, you're tipping your hand.

You're afraid.

I am afraid.

Today, I got a glimpse of what war between us might look like.

Your people wouldn't stand a chance.

The Council couldn't care less.

I'm trying to save you from annihilation.

Well, well.

Not the fresh-faced Academy pledge, are you?

You want peace, this is the price.

( sighs )

You'll discontinue the production of Shimmer?

Half there already.
Return the Gemstone.

And I need Jinx.

She has to pay for what she's done.

They weren't her crimes. She was working for me.

Believe me, if I had it my way, it'd be you rotting in Stillwater, but we can't make a deal with a snake and cut off its head.

We both have our shitty parts to play.

Get me Jinx. And I'll give you your nation of Zaun.

Councilors...

My recent unsanctioned activities in the underground have shown me two things.

I'm not fit to govern the people who live there.

And neither are you.

Our opportunity to demonstrate our compassion, our dedication, our solidarity has passed.

They're right not to trust us.

You're walking a fine line, Jayce.

With respect, I don't give a sh¡t what any of you think of me anymore.

Except you.

You were right.

You were always right.

My days here are numbered, but I've come with Viktor, my partner and a Zaunite, with one final proposal.

Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco.

In exchange for the undercity's independence.

What? Nonsense! We have procedures...

Wanna know a secret?

Silco thinks he made Jinx, with all his rants and his hard-won lessons.

"Excise your doubts, Jinx."

"Be what they fear, Jinx."

Like everything was the same as when Vander left him.

But he didn't make Jinx.

You did.

I'm sorry, Powder.

I never meant to leave you.

              JINX

You never left.

I always heard you.

Shadows in the streets, prickles on the back of my neck.

Your voice.

Pushing me.

Picking me up when all the colors were black.

You're the reason I'm still alive.

I spent so many nights in that shitty prison.

On the freezing floor, hungry, bloody, counting the hours.

The only thing...

The only thing that kept me going was the thought of getting back to you.

              JINX

Are we still sisters?

Nothing is ever going to change that.

Mm.

No! Powder, listen.

We... we can just go.

We'll leave and never come back.

( gasps )

Where would we go?

No, no, no. She's not saying that.

It's true, we'll put this behind us.

You'll never have to see him again, Powder.

( mumbles )

What do you have to say about that?

Her name is Jinx!

She's lying.

You'll be with her a day before she realizes you aren't that girl anymore and turns her back on you.

Mm-hmm.

You aren't lying?

                JINX

You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.

I'm not lying.

I'm on your side. I promise.

Shut up! We're talking!

The topsiders offered me everything.

                SILCO

Independence, a seat at the table.

All in return for you.

They can all burn.

Everyone betrays us, Jinx. Vander. Her.
